				<p>We work on cutting-edge problems at the intersection of computation and medicine. We are interested
					in scientists with diverse backgrounds and training, who share a love for this intersection and
					care about clinical impact. We are currently hiring at multiple levels. Interested applicants should read the information below
					and our <a href="pdfs/Prospective Applicants Guide.pdf">application guide</a>, and then <a href="mailto:brodyfoy@uw.edu">email Brody</a>.
					<br><br>
					If you don’t match the categories below but still think you are a good fit for the lab, please send an email
					with your CV and an explanation.

			<h2> UNDERGRADUATES</h2>
			<p>We can offer research-for-credit projects for UW undergraduates only. Interested students should
				have experience with programming in a data-analysis language (R, Python, MATLAB) and have taken at least
				one university-level statistics class. Applicants should follow instructions in the
				lab manual. Note that we do not take on high school students in any capacity.

			<h2> GRADUATE STUDENTS</h2>
			<p> Currently enrolled masters/PhD students at UW interested in either a rotation or full-term project
				should email a CV and explanation of their research goals. For thesis committee requests email a CV, and project outline.
				<br><br>
				Most graduate programs at UW are not direct admit – meaning I cannot admit you to the lab if
				you are not already enrolled at UW.
				However, if you are an exceptional student whose background and interests are strongly aligned with our
				lab, please email a CV and brief explanation of your research
				goals. Due to uncertainty of entry, applicants who are not an extremely strong fit may not receive a
				reply.

			<h2>POSTDOCS & RESIDENTS</h2>
			<p>We are interested in postdocs with computational skills and illustrated prior
				interests in healthcare or biology. We also offer projects for UW residents who have at least some
				programming
				experience. Applicants should email a CV, at least one prior
				publication, and a brief description of your research goals.
			</p>

			<h2>EXPECTATIONS & PHILOSOPHY</h2>
			<p>A detailed overview of expectations and philosophy of our lab is given in the <a href="pdfs/Prospective Applicants Guide.pdf">application guide</a>.
				We believe in collaborative, open-science, and creating a supportive environment for all members. All members will have opportunity
				to shape the direction of their project, to learn new skills, and to set development goals that align
				with their future career interests. We aim to work hard and do good science, but to ensure we have rich
				and rewarding lives outside of academia.
